# CooksCorner1.0
My first .net website

I have not yet done live testing, but the website is live at www.cooks-corner.co.uk.

The front end is very rough and needs work, I am doing that as I learn more CSS, HTML and jquery/java

The plan is to replace the currrent Java comments system with signal R.
